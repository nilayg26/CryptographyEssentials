# CryptographyEssentials
Comprehensive Cryptographic Algorithms in Java
This repository contains a collection of implementations for various cryptographic algorithms. The repository is divided into two main sections: Symmetric Key Cryptography and Asymmetric Key Cryptography. Additionally, it includes implementations for the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and some bonus algorithms.

# Symmetric Key Cryptography
1)Playfair Cipher
2)Vigenere Cipher
3)Shift Cipher

# Asymmetric Key Cryptography
1)RSA Cryptosystem
2)Elgamal Cryptosystem

# Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
Implementation of DSS for authentication purposes in various protocols.

# Bonus Algorithms
1)Finding Primitive Roots
2)Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean Algorithm

This repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning the practical implementation of cryptographic algorithms. 

# Disclaimer
These algorithms are provided as basic demonstrations and are not intended for real-world cryptographic applications. They are designed for educational and learning purposes only.
