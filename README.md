# CryptographyEssentials
This repository contains a collection of implementations for various cryptographic algorithms in Java Code. The repository is divided into two main sections: Substitution Cipher Cryptography and Asymmetric Public Key Cryptography. Additionally, it includes implementations for the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and various bonus algorithms.

    1)Playfair Cipher 
    2)Vigenere Cipher
    3)Shift Cipher

## Asymmetric Key Cryptography [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) | [ElGamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption) | [Diffie Hellman Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange)
    1)RSA Cryptosystem 
    2)ElGamal Cryptosystem
    3)Diffie Hellman Key Exchange 

## Digital Signature Standard [DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Standard)
Implementation of DSS for authentication purposes in various protocols.

## Bonus Algorithms [Primitive Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n) | [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) | [Transposition Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher) | [Modular Exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation) | [Modular Multiplicative Inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) | [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
    1)Finding Primitive Roots
    2)Modular Exponentiation
