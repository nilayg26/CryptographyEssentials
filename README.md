# CryptographyEssentials
This repository contains a collection of implementations for various cryptographic algorithms. The repository is divided into two main sections: Substitution Cipher Cryptography and Asymmetric Key Cryptography. Additionally, it includes implementations for the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and some bonus algorithms.

## Substitution Cipher Cryptography
    1)Playfair Cipher 
    2)Vigenere Cipher
    3)Shift Cipher

## Asymmetric Key Cryptography
    1)RSA Cryptosystem [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
    2)Elgamal Cryptosystem

## Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
Implementation of DSS for authentication purposes in various protocols.

## Bonus Algorithms
    1)Finding Primitive Roots
    2)Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean Algorithm
    3)Padding of SHA-512
    4)A basic Demonstration of Transposition Cipher Cyrptography.
